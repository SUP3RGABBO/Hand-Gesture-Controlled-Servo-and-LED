Hand-Gesture-Controlled-Servo-and-LED
This project uses a webcam and the MediaPipe library to recognize hand gestures and control a servo motor and an LED via Arduino.
This project uses a webcam and the MediaPipe library to recognize hand gestures and control a servo motor and an LED via Arduino.

- The **servo** moves based on the distance between the thumb and index finger.
- The **LED** is on by default and turns off when the hand is closed (thumb close to index and pinky close to thumb).
- The project uses Python for image processing and PySerial for communication with Arduino.
